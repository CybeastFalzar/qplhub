            <h1>Summary </h1>
            <p>This is an A* (pronounced "A Star") path-finding example, written in Javascript. It should be noted that this a more basic example of A*, and that there are methods which can be used to optimize this algorithm, such as checking to see if A space is blocked by a diagonal wall, checking the lowest movement costs first, etc. This example will NOT WORK on Internet Explorer.</p>
            
            <h1>Explanation</h1>
            <p>A* pathfinding is a little complicated to explain, so for more information, I'll refer you to <a href = "https://youtu.be/-L-WgKMFuhE">this fantastic tutorial by Sebastian Lague.</a> In it, he covers the basic concept of A*, as well as the pseudo-code used to create this example.</p>
            <p>A* pathfinding uses an algoritm defined by:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>gCost : distance from any node to the starting point</li>
              <li>hCost : distance from any node to the endPoint</li>
              <li>fCost : gCost + hCost</li>
              <li>each movement is weighted, based on pythagorean triangles. A diaganol movement costs 14, and a horizontal or vertical movement costs 10. (these numbers just make the math a little easier)</li>
            </ul>
